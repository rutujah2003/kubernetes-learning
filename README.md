Introduction to Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust framework for running applications in a highly available and fault-tolerant manner.

Creating Pods in Kubernetes
There are two primary methods to create pods in Kubernetes: imperative and declarative.

1. Imperative Method
The imperative way involves directly issuing commands to create resources. It is straightforward and typically used for quick tasks or debugging. For example, to create a pod using an image, the command is:

bash
Copy code
kubectl run nginx-pod --image=nginx
This command creates a pod named nginx-pod with the nginx image.

Advantages:

Quick and easy for testing and small tasks.
No need to write configuration files.
Disadvantages:

Not easily repeatable.
Limited documentation of the deployment process.
2. Declarative Method
The declarative approach involves defining the desired state of the resource in a YAML or JSON file and applying that configuration using kubectl. For example:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
This YAML file can be applied with:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
Advantages:

More structured and maintainable.
Allows for version control and documentation of the configuration.
Easier to reproduce the same setup across different environments.
Disadvantages:

Requires additional steps to create and manage YAML files.
May be more complex for beginners.
